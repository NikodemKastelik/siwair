# Order queue:
# It is an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains keys 'id' and 'contents'.
# This pair of keys describes single order. Value of the 'id' key represents order unique identifier.
# It is a number and its type is a String. Value of the 'contents' key is the array of dictionaries.
# Each entry in this array represents single product. Each product consists of 'quantity' and 'recipe' key.
# Value of the 'quantity' key equals to amount of the products specified by the value of the 'recipe' key.
# First key is a number and its type is a String, while the second one is a string and its type is also a String.
# There are maximum 6 products in a single order, which means that sum of all values of 'quantity' keys
# across single 'contents' array is lesser or equal to 6.

# Value of the 'progress' key represents progress of the order currently processed by Master PLC.
# It it a number and its type is a String.
